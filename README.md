# ML-exercises
 
This repo contains very un-optimized optimizer code for curve fitting by optimization using the gradient descent in TensorFlow. 

To run the tests, set up a virtual environment for Python 3.7, then:

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
python exerciseX.py
```

Then, tap your feet while waiting and admire the fantastic choices of initial conditions. If you are impatient, view the finished results in the exercise_X.png images in the docs folder.
